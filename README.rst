prettify.py
===========

For prettier (and helpful) Python exceptions.

Heavily inspired by Qix' `better-exceptions <https://github.com/Qix-/better-exceptions/>`_ module.


Features
--------

#. Everything from ``better-exceptions``, plus;
#. Support for recent Python versions,
#. Slightly more complex debugging, and;
#. A highly customizable object interface


Hooking prettify.py
-------------------

Not unlike ``better-exceptions``, this module can hook into your python sessions via the ``PY_PRETTIFY_EXC`` environment variable.
